Sorted after importance

- Baseline calculations to make different fonts look better in combination and allow text on e.g. an arch

- Speed: Think about:
  - Binary XML (i.e. fast infoset), or a temp file, because xml-parsing has a speed problem)
  - Parsing of Paths and Evaluation of bezier curves in parallel with Accelerate

- Auto Hinting (this depends on how the rasterization in the backend works):
  If you compare Example.hs opened in gedit with the SVG generated by Example.hs the advantage of 
  hinting becomes obvious.
